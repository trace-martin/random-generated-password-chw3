## Randomly Generated Password using User input.

### What I learned:

#### During this project, I was able to deepen my understanding of:

1.How nested functions perform versus calling functions within another function. 
2.How variables globally scoped versus locally scoped affects the code.
3.How to create windowed prompts.
4.How to accept user input and apply it back to the function.
5.And Conditional Statements/Loops.

## User Instructions:

To use the program please travel to the site here___link____.
Once at the webpage, you will need to click the generate password button. 
After clicking, you will be prompted to select ***between 8 - 128 characters***. If you choose a number outside of that range, you will be given an error message and must restart by clicking the generate password button again. 
After selecting an acceptable amount of characters, you will then be prompted to select, if you want, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

***YOU MUST*** choose at least ***one*** argument for the program to run. If you fail to choose one, then the program will again give you an error message but this time instead of having to re-click the button, you will simply have to restart from question #1 (how many characters long do you want the password to be?).

Once you have fulfilled the requirements for the “algorithm” to run, then your password will be displayed in the text box where you will be able to highlight and copy.
