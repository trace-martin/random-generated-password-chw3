# Random Password Generator
<hr>

## Randomly Generated Password using User input.

<hr>

### What I learned:

#### During this project, I was able to deepen my understanding of:

1.How nested functions perform versus calling functions within another function.<br>
2.How variables globally scoped versus locally scoped affects the code.<br>
3.How to create windowed prompts.<br>
4.How to accept user input and apply it back to the function.<br>
5.And Conditional Statements/Loops.<br>

## User Instructions:

To use the program please travel to the site https://trace-martin.github.io/random-generated-password-chw3/.
Once at the webpage, you will need to click the ***Generate Password button.*** <br>

After clicking, you will be prompted to select ***between 8*** - ***128 characters***. <br><br>
If you choose a number outside of that range, you will be given an error message and must restart by clicking the generate password button again.<br><br>
After selecting an acceptable amount of characters, you will then be prompted to select, if you want, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. <br>

***YOU MUST*** choose at least ***one*** argument for the program to run.<br><br>
If you fail to choose one, then the program will again give you an error message but this time instead of having to re-click the button,<br>
you will simply have to restart from question #1 (how many characters long do you want the password to be?).<br>

Once you have fulfilled the requirements for the “algorithm” to run, then your password will be displayed in the text box where you will be able to highlight and copy.<br>
